website for storing other website's password(Done for study purpose)
                                In todays world remembering passwords,username's of all our accounts around different websites is nearly impossible.So,I create a solution for that.I created a website in which user should create a account and then they can password and usernames of different websites.     
                                it will help you regarding the storing of huge data and it will also make the time complexity less as compaired to other and it is safe and sequre to use.
